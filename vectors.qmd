# Vector Basics

## Position vectors

The *position vector* of a point shows how to get to that point *from the origin*.

![Points on a coordinate plane](img/vec points on a coord plane.png)
The *position vector* of point P is $\begin{pmatrix}1 \\3\end{pmatrix}$. We write $\vec{OP} = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\3\end{pmatrix}$.
What is the position vector of Q?

## Column vectors

Vectors written in the form $\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}$ are called column vectors.

## Vectors as Arrows

You can think of a vector as an arrow. Like an arrow, a vector has *magnitude* (length) and *direction*. 

What is the magnitude of $\vec{OQ}$ in the diagram above? 

## Vectors that are not position vectors

How do you think you could write $\vec{PQ}$ in the form $\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}$?
Hint: How do you get from P to Q?
How do you think you could write $\vec{QP}$ in the form $\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}$?
## Adding vectors

In general, you can add two vectors by adding their components:

$\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\y_1\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}x_2\\y_2\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}x_1+x_2\\y_1+y_2\end{pmatrix}$

What is $\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}$ in the form $\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}$?

## Multiplying a vector by a number (scalar multiplication)

In general, you can multiply a vector by a number by multiplying its components by that number:

$k\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}kx\\ky\end{pmatrix}$

## Vectors without x and y

Usually in GCSE questions, we will not get an xy-coordinate plane to work with. Instead, we will be given *names* for some position vectors, and we will need to work out other vectors *in terms of* those vectors.

In the diagram:

$\vec{OP} = \mathbf{a}$
$\vec{OR} = \mathbf{b}$

Given that OPRQ is a parallelogram, write down the following in terms of **a** and **b**:

1. $\vec{PR}$
2. $\vec{QR}$
3. $\vec{OR}$
4. $\vec{RP}$
5. $\vec{RQ}$
6. $\vec{PQ}$
7. $\vec{QP}$

## Exercise: Vector Basics

**Question 1**

![[Pasted image 20250519220302.png]]
Draw the vector -2**a** on the grid.

**Question 2**

Given that

$\vec{AB} = \begin{pmatrix}2 \\3\end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{BC} = \begin{pmatrix}5 \\-2\end{pmatrix}$

Calculate $\vec{CA}$ as a column vector.

**Question 3**

Given that

	$\vec{AC} = \begin{pmatrix}-21 \\15\end{pmatrix}$
	B is the point on AC such that AB:BC = 1:2

Calculate $\vec{AB}$ as a column vector.
